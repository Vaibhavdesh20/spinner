        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            ISA was formed in 1985 by leading spinners like Rajasthan Spinning & Wvg Mills Ltd, Aditya Mills, Banswara Syntex, etc. The objective was to protect the interests of spinning mills using man-made and natural fibers.
        </p>
        <p>
            During those days, man-made fibers carried high duties and faced availability issues. ISA took steps to represent to the Central Govt about hurdles faced by spinners and advocated policy changes for smoother business flow, including exports and imports.
