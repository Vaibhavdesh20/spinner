          <p >ISA was formed in 1985 by leading spinners like Rajasthan Spinning & Wvg Mills Ltd, Aditya Mills, Banswara Syntex, etc. The objective of ISA was to protect the interests of spinning mills using man-made fibers and natural fibers. During those days, man-made fibers carried very high duties, and availability was also an issue.</p>
          <p>India was a controlled economy, and there were too many regulations to be complied with. Export imports were also highly regulated. ISA took all necessary steps to represent to the central government about various hurdles faced by spinners and support needed from the government.</p>
          <p>ISA represented to the government about policy changes needed to have a smooth business flow, including export and imports. ISA took business delegations abroad to appraise yarn users about India's potential as yarn exporters.</p>
